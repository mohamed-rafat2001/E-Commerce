🚀 **Exciting Milestone: Version 1 of my E-Commerce API is officially LIVE!** 🚀

I'm thrilled to announce that I've just completed the first major version of a robust, scalable E-Commerce API. This project has been an incredible journey of architecting a multi-role system that handles everything from secure authentication to complex order management.

### **🔹 What is this API?**
This is a comprehensive RESTful API designed to power modern e-commerce platforms. It features a sophisticated role-based access control (RBAC) system supporting **Customers**, **Sellers**, **Admins**, and **Employees**, ensuring each user has a tailored and secure experience.

### **✨ Key Features & Functionalities:**
*   🔐 **Advanced Auth System:** Secure JWT-based authentication, role-based authorization, and password encryption.
*   📦 **Product & Inventory Management:** Full CRUD operations for products and categories, including image uploads via Cloudinary.
*   🛒 **Smart Shopping Cart:** Seamless cart management with persistent storage.
*   🧾 **Order Processing:** End-to-end order lifecycle management from checkout to delivery tracking.
*   ⭐ **Social Features:** Integrated Review and Rating system for products, plus a personalized Wishlist.
*   👤 **Profile Management:** Specialized profiles for Sellers (business details) and Customers (shipping/payment preferences).
*   📧 **Automated Notifications:** Email integration for account verification and order updates.
*   🛠️ **Developer Friendly:** Fully documented with Swagger UI and built with a global error handling factory.

### **💻 Technologies Used:**
*   **Runtime:** Node.js
*   **Framework:** Express.js
*   **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose (Complex schemas & relationships)
*   **Security:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) & Bcrypt
*   **File Storage:** Cloudinary API
*   **Documentation:** Swagger / OpenAPI
*   **Validation:** Custom middleware for request body validation

This project has sharpened my skills in backend architecture, database modeling, and building secure production-ready services. I'm already looking forward to V2!
